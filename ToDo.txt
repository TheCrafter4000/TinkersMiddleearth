- General
	- Interaction with a smeltery requires +100 faction alignment
	- Disable alloy furnaces (Disable crafting recipe and cancel GUI)
	- Remove bronze handcrafting recipe
	- Port to latest lotR version
	- Update Books. They are the only wiki right now.
	- Fix lotR Recipes not working with tinker's items cuz LotR recipes don't use OreDictionary for no reason
	
- Smeltery Update
	- Usage & Recipes
		- Only fluids next to each other will create alloys
	- Fuel overhaul
		- new block type; "Smeltery heat source".
			- Smelter heat source, will burn fuel
				- The lower the burn time, the lower the max temp the smeltery will have.
				- The bigger the smeltery, the quicker fuel will be consumed
					- perhaps adding ways to generate good heat without lava
						- maybe special combination (wood + coal, etc.)
						- maybe extra fuel (research needed)
			- Lava heat source; Requires lava and can hold alot of it, more than a tank
				- Can smelt mithril
				- Only for dwarven?
		- maybe adding bellows
			- Increases heat, but fuel will be consumed quicker
			- Two states; Full and Empty of air. Will need redstone signal to Empty, and will require no signal to Fill. (player has to use a redstone clock or his bare hands to operate it)
	- Building
		- more faction-based smelteries and a special structure for each smeltery that buffs it in some way
		- Seared faction bricks
			- Add faction-suitable grout recipes (mordor gravel, white sand, etc)
			- Basin recipe; 2 molten ingots + faction brick = seared faction brick
	- Better steel (research needed on how is actually made, both in RL and ME)
	
- Modifier Update
	- Scrolls are modifier
		- Different levels stack
		- To apply them, you need gems. lvl1 needs x1, lvl2 needs x3, lvl3 needs x6, and so on... 
			- it's cheaper to combine lower levels than apply the highest level directly

	- Banes
		- Banes can stack(will take longer to acquire exponentionally, while effect grows linearly)
		- Won't require modifier, but grant one extra modifier? (maybe to OP)
		
	- New Scrolls
		- "United": The higher your alignment with a specific faction, the higher the chance to not consume durability. Caps at 90% (durability x10).
			- Durability boost is x1 at 2500, x2 at 5000 and x10 at 25000 alignment. Below 2500 the tools durability will decrease, and above 25000 boost stays constant.
			- Very very very rare mob drop from elite units (Black uruk, Swan knight, etc.)
				- To get the drop, you need atleast -5000 with the mob faction, so sloughtering your allies won't do the trick
			- You need atleast 2500+ alignment with your faction to apply it
			- Replaces "Durability" modifier

- Tool Tinkering Update
	- Change color/texture of specific parts (see "Dyer" branch)
	- Parts
		- Faction-specific texture, model and properties (glowing elven blade)
			- Faction specific workstations/partbuilders/etc
				- material restriction (configuratable)
		- Could take multiple steps to create one part ("tinkering intensifies" achievement if player modifies 100 parts)
			- Handle
				- Could be treated with leather/fur/feathers
				- Wood types give different properties
			- Binding
				- Gems could be applied
			- Extra
				- gems
				- leather/fur
			- Weapon head
			- Tool Head
	
- Armor Update
	- Modifiers
		- Autoforge (ultra rare (utumno lava level-only) scroll modifier, taking a bath in molten metal repairs your armor)
