- General
	- Interact with a smeltery requires +100 alignment
	- Disable alloy furnaces (Disable crafting recipe and cancel GUI)
	- Remove bronze crafting recipe
	- Port to latest lotR version
	- Update Books. They are the only wiki right now.
	- Fix lotR Recipes not working with tinker's items
	
- Smeltery Update
	- Usage & Recipes
		- Only fluids next to each other will create alloys
	- Fuel overhaul
		- new block type; "Smeltery heat source".
			- Smelter heat source, will burn fuel
				- The lower the burn time, the lower the max temp the smeltery will have.
				- The bigger the smeltery, the quicker fuel will be consumed
					- perhaps adding ways to generate good heat without lava
						- maybe special combination (wood + coal, etc.)
						- maybe extra fuel (research needed)
			- Lava heat source; Requires lava and can hold alot of it, more than a tank
				- Can smelt mithril
		- maybe adding bellows
			- Increases heat, but fuel will be consumed quicker
			- Two states; Full and Empty of air. Will need redstone signal to Empty, and will require no signal to Fill. (TL;DR player has to use a redstone clock or a lever to operate it)
	- Building
		- more faction-based smelteries and a special structure for each smeltery that buffs it in some way
		- Seared faction bricks
			- Add faction-suitable grout recipes (mordor gravel, white sand, etc)
			- Basin recipe; 2 molten ingots + faction brick = seared faction brick
	- Better steel (research needed)
	
- Modifier Update
	- Scrolls are modifier
		- Different levels stack
		- To apply them, you need gems. Incompatible Modifiers use the same gem, and there can only be one modification type per gem.
	- Banes
		- Banes can stack(will take longer to acquire exponentionally)
		- Won't require modifier, but grant one extra modifier
			- maybe remove one level of bane if you actually use the extra modifier? (modifing your weapon reduces the bane)
	- New Scrolls
		- "United": The higher your alignment with a specific faction, the higher the chance to not consume durability. Caps at 80% (durability x5).
			- Very very very rare mob drop from elite units (Black uruk, Swan knight, etc.)
				- They will drop the scroll for their own faction, which is evil to you. Players have to trade with others to obtain useable scrolls.
					- Config can swap that, e.g. for singleplayer
				- To get the drop, you need atleast -5000 with the mob faction
			- You need atleast 2500+ alignment with your faction to apply it
			- Replace "durable" modifier?

- Tool Tinkering Update
	- Change color/texture of specific parts (see "Dyer" branch)
	- Parts
		- Faction-specific texture, model and properties (glowing elven blade)
			- Faction specific workstations/partbuilders/etc
				- material restriction (configuratable)
		- Could take multiple steps to create one part ("tinkering intensifies" achievement if player modifies 100 parts)
			- Handle
				- Could be treated with leather/fur
			- Binding
				- Gems could be applied. idk. am tired.
			- Extra
				- gems
				- leather/fur
			- Weapon head
			- Tool Head
	
- Armor Update (likely never to come)
	- Modifiers
		- Autoforge (ultra rare (utumno lava level-only) scroll modifier, taking a bath in molten metal repairs your armor)
