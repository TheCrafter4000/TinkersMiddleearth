# About this Mod
This mod is an addon for Tinker's Construct. It tries to make it as much as possible compatible with Mevans Lord of the Rings mod.
# How to setup the workspace
First you need deobfuscated versions of the mods this mod is depending on. I will not upload these for copyright reasons. I know about CodeChickenCore, which can deobfuscate at runtime, but it didn't worked by me cause it deobfuscates some classes it shouldn't. So I recommend using BON2, an program that can deobfuscate an mod. Now you could set up your workspace as a usual forge workspace. Add the deobfuscated mods on build path. If the mods source code is public, include it. Maybe you need to do some gradle stuff, but I didn't remember what I had done exactly.
